        <p>Suva is the capital of the South Pacific island nation of Fiji. It's a city of broad avenues, lush parks and
            grand
            British colonial buildings, such as the Suva City Library. Suva's colorful, lively Municipal Market offers a
            range of
            local fruit and vegetables. Fiji Museum, set within the Victorian-era Thurston Gardens, contains examples of
            traditional
            canoes, war clubs and tattooing tools
